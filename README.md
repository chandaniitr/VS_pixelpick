VS_pixelpick
============

This is a small tool to see color code of the pixel under mouse.

Many times when designing in HTML/CSS, we want to copy color. This tool tells color code of any pixel that is below the mouse pointer. It occupies a small portion of screen's top-left corner, and if we move mouse over there, the window moves to bottom-left corner so we can hover over pixels in that corner.

UI isn't great as I wanted speed and quick startup time.

Color is reported as RGB, in decimal as well as hex. (like RGB : 255 255 255 | ff ff ff).

The application is designed such that it keeps reporting pixel color even when the window has lost focus.

To Quit the application, press Shift+Q, anytime (even when the window has lost focus).

Any suggestion is highly appreciated.
